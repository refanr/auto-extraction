# Automatic Extraction of Logical Relationships from Icelandic Text

## Short Description
This course is dedicated to the exploration of automatic entity extraction and entity relationship extraction from text, using rule-based methods on a small, sparse dataset. The automatic extraction of logical relationships from Icelandic text is a non-trivial task that cannot be done well with any known methods. The main goal of this course is to explore methods for entity extraction and relationship extraction, with the Icelandic Legal Code (Lagasafn Íslands, Íslensk lög) as a use-case. 

In the course, a variety of rule-based, causal-relation building, statistical approaches, and other methods will be contrasted with ANN methods like popular recent LLMs, such as DeepSeek R1 or Open AI GPT o1 or o3.
