# Automatic Extraction of Logical Relationships from Icelandic Text

## Short Description
This course is about automatic text analysis, in particular, methods for representing knowledge about logical relationships described in text. A variety of rule-based artificial intelligence methods for text knowledge extraction will be studied, especially those with a strong focus on automatic extraction/identification of entities, and entity relationship extraction. Compared to other languages, Icelandic has a limited dataset and the focus here is on methods that work for such sparse data. Automatic extraction of logical relationships from Icelandic text is a non-trivial task that cannot be done well with any known methods. The main goal of this course is to learn about and explore methods for entity extraction and relationship extraction that show promise as future methods for small datasets. As a use-case, the Icelandic Legal Code (Lagasafn Íslands, Íslensk lög) will provide a concrete context for the course assignments.
