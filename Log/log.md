# Project Log

## 13.2.2025
Been spending a few days reading literature about entity and relation extraction from text. I am not convinced that NER methods are the way to go, found something called Ontology Learning which is promising. Am doing a preliminary Literature review on this at the moment. Have already gotten the Íslensk lög text from the .html files from althingi.is, done some cleaning of the text, stripping away some of the preamble in the laws and cleaning up some of the text extraction mess.

### Tasks:
- Text extracted from html files
- Started cleaning the text
- Literature review


## 9.2.2025
I want to start with downloading and preparing the Icelandic legal code. The althingi.is website offers a .zip download of the legal code as it stands. The code is updated three times per annum, and the most recent update was published 1.September, 2024.

### Tasks:
- Set up this repository
- Downloaded the Icelandic Legal code
